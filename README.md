# Optimization Course 2024

This repository contains the assignments for the "Optimization Course" taught by PhD. Joaquín Peña Acevedo at CIMAT (Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas), developed in the Python programming language. The code is written in Spanish.

## Assigments

### 1. Optimization Fundamentals
In this assignment, the golden section method is programmed to find the minimum of a function, and it begins the exploration of line search methods for optimization.

### 2. Line Search Methods (Part 1)
In this assignment, the exact gradient descent algorithm for quadratic functions and the gradient descent with the golden section method are programmed and tested.

### 3. Line Search Methods (Part 2)
In this assignment, the gradient descent algorithm with backtracking using Armijo's condition is implemented, along with another version featuring a modified step size.

### 4. Newton's Method
In this assignment, the Newton and Damped Newton methods are programmed, and an efficient, compact representation of Hartmann's function, along with its gradient and Hessian, is implemented.

### 5. Trust Region Methods
In this assignment, an analysis of the Newton Method and convex functions is conducted, and the trust region method with the Cauchy point is implemented.

### 6. Conjugate Gradient Methods
In this assignment, the conjugate gradient method is implemented, along with other versions that use the Fletcher-Reeves and Hestenes-Stiefel formulas, as well as the Wolfe condition for backtracking.

### 7. Line search Newton with conjugate gradient
In this assignment, the line search Newton method with conjugate gradient is implemented. In addition, a numerical analysis is conducted to assess the performance of gradient and Hessian approximations.

### 8. BFGS method
In this assigment, the Quasi-Newton method with BFGS update is implemented.

### 9. Logistic Regression and Gauss-Newton Method
In this assignment, the logistic regression task is applied to a binary classification problem, and a regression task is performed using the Gauss-Newton method.
