# Optimization Course 2024

This repository contains the assignments for the "Optimization Course" taught by PhD. Joaquín Peña Acevedo at CIMAT (Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas), developed in the Python programming language. The code is written in Spanish.

## Assigments

### 1. Optimization Fundamentals
In this assignment, the golden section method is programmed to find the minimum of a function, and it begins the exploration of line search methods for optimization.

### 2. Line Search Methods (Part 1)
In this assignment, the exact gradient descent algorithm for quadratic functions and the gradient descent with the golden section method are programmed and tested.

### 3. Line Search Methods (Part 2)
In this assignment, the gradient descent algorithm with backtracking using Armijo's condition is implemented, along with another version featuring a modified step size.

### 4. Newton's Method
In this assignment, the Newton and Damped Newton methods are programmed, and an efficient, compact representation of Hartmann's function, along with its gradient and Hessian, is implemented.

### 5. Trust Region Methods
In this assignment, an analysis of the Newton Method and convex functions is conducted, and the trust region method with the Cauchy point is implemented.
