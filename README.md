# Optimization Course 2024

This repository contains the assignments for the "Optimization Course" taught by PhD. Joaquín Peña Acevedo at CIMAT (Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas), developed in the Python programming language. The code is written in Spanish.

## Assigments

### 1. Optimization Fundamentals
In this assignment, the golden section method is programmed to find the minimum of a function, and it begins the exploration of line search methods for optimization.

### 2. Line Search Methods (Part 1)
In this assignment, the exact gradient descent algorithm for quadratic functions and the gradient descent with the golden section method are programmed and tested.

### 3. Line Search Methods (Part 2)
In this assignment, the gradient descent algorithm with backtracking using Armijo's condition is implemented, along with another version featuring a modified step size.
